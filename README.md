## Synopsis
Unity game created at the K-State 48hr Game Jame (2015). The theme was cybersecurity. The gameplay for our game was inspired by "Five Nights at Freddy's." Our game takes place on a computer desktop where the player is trying to move as many of their files to safety as possible before the computer virus has taken over the whole system. Meanwhile the virus is causing all sorts of mischief across different applications that the player is having to handle while also saving files in whatever free moments they have.
